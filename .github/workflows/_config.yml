# Between the Pipelines

**Between the Pipelines** is a personal blog by [Liam Witterick](https://github.com/liam-witterick), exploring the human, strategic, and occasionally chaotic side of modern CloudOps.

This site captures real-world insights, patterns, and stories from the world of:
- Cloud infrastructure (AWS + Azure)
- Kubernetes & Helm
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, ArgoCD)
- Terraform
- Platform thinking
- Leadership in DevOps

Built using [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## üöÄ Running Locally

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
mkdocs serve
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000` to view the site.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deploying

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

This will build the static site and push it to the `gh-pages` branch for GitHub Pages hosting.
